Hey folks, Prakash here. I am a fullstack developer and have been professionally developing softwares since 2019.  

I mostly write about the stuff I encounter in my day to day professional life. 
Sometimes, I write about the domain specific stuff. 
I also like to experiment with idiosyncrasies of Python and JS, and come up with code snippets 
which most likely would be treated as abominations by fellow developers ðŸ˜›

I usually spend my free time playing games on my PS5.
